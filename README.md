# README

I decided to make repo public but I'm too lazy to add proper README.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è To-Do (Maybe)

- Refactor code  
- Add ORM  
- Upgrade to PostgreSQL  

But probably not gonna do it as I keep delaying :D

P.s. by the way this was one if my first python projects after learning the language so hope you don't judge hard :)
